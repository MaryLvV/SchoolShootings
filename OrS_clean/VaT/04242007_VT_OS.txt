The aftermath of last week's massacre has produced a raft of speculations as to what went wrong. In Saturday's Sentinel alone, inadequate attention by schools to students' writings, excessive pressure on young people, a lack of kind deeds and, of course, wicked, evil guns were presented as culprits.  Tuesday's headline asked, "WHY WASN'T HE STOPPED?", as if the key mistake occurred on the morning of the killings. A better question would be, "Why wasn't he noticed long before?" It seems to me that the problem is not inattentive officials, undermedicated brains or underregulated guns. Any society is going to produce a certain number of dangerously unstable individuals. We don't notice them because we don't know each other. We've created a society in which it's comfortable and convenient to be a hermit.  Instead of human relationships, we assume that if the paperwork is all in order, the person must be OK. We've replaced community with bureaucracy. The machinery of bureaucracy has many gaps. People fall through them all the time. Usually, the result is private aggravation or private tragedy. Occasionally, like Monday of last week, it's much, much worse.  If we want to prevent future (and perhaps worse) massacres than the one at Virginia Tech, we are going to have to make changes that are deeper than simply giving school counselors and gun sellers another form to fill out.
