In the wake of Virginia Tech, the media, the right and the left will begin dissecting in detail the failures of society that brought this tragedy to bear. The Fear Industrial Complex will take this opportunity to expand Homeland Security. We obviously need to monitor suspicious and potentially dangerous people. The kid just dumped by his first love. Your neighbor, who just lost his job or his wife to another. The millions who fail to achieve the standard of consumption society deems successful. The sullen or withdrawn.  It will be a witch hunt of epic proportions -- state-ordered screening of "potential evildoers" right out of Minority Report, at the least a continued erosion of whatever civil liberties are left.  We are a fat, lazy nation of sheep, demanding our government protect us from all harm, even harm from ourselves: fast food, cigarettes, anything offensive. If we can't stop ourselves we want our Nanny State to step in. Look no further than New Orleans to measure your government's ability to protect you.  We are taxation livestock to a government largely run by corporate America. The fear mongers will be banging the drum right up to the elections, and the candidates will be pandering like never before, making promises to super-entitled masses who have long forgotten that life itself is a risk.  Be vigilant. Vote fearlessly.
