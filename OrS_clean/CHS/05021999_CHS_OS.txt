ALONG WITH many others, I watched the memorial service for the slain students and teacher at Columbine High School. Most of the speakers and musicians wove a common thread that love and forgiveness are keys to overcoming the heinous acts. The releasing of the doves was both touching and symbolic. But I was struck by the absence of a dove for the two alleged perpetrators. I am not a liberal, and I disdain the oft-used victimization claims as an excuse for unacceptable behavior. However, in this case I believe that these two young men were also victims. They were not born evil. Something or someone influenced their minds; pick your cause. And they did have some redeeming qualities as evidenced by interviews with classmates and neighbors. Indeed I have not heard anyone say they were problem kids. Therefore, it would have been fitting to start the healing process right then with doves for Eric and Dylan to symbolize letting go. By omission, evil had one last victory.
THE TRAGEDY of Columbine High School will repeat itself until we make some very serious changes in our society. It is a cry for help. Our society has come to accept violence and hatred as a part of life. Our children watch violent shows, are handed toy guns and violent games, and then we expect them to understand that it is only a game. We are then shocked at tragedies such as the shootings in Colorado. We are killing our children. The next to die could be yours. Take action! Don't buy violent games; don't let your children have them. Don't attend violent movies and don't watch violent shows. We must stop buying into the violence that has become popular in our society. Only then will the violence stop being produced. Also, talk to your children, love them, hug them and be involved. Their challenges and choices are more frightening than we know about, and they need your support. If you don't listen to them now, you may never have the chance to again.
