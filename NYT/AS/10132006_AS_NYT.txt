Re “Amish Destroy Schoolhouse Where 10 Girls Were Shot” (news article, Oct. 13):

A week after the violence, the Amish have cleared the site of the building and planted various grasses and clover to return the site to pastureland.

What a contrast to another site of violence, ground zero, where the bickering and gawking continue five years later.

Perhaps it’s as simple as the vast difference in the value of the two sites financially, but the Amish seem to have the right values about moving on. Susan J. Behrens
