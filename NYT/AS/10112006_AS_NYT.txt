To the Editor:

Re “Bush Emphasizes Local, Private Role in Ending School Violence” (news article, Oct. 11):

Providing “information about strategies to help parents and schools grappling with the threat of deadly outbursts in the nation’s schools,” as President Bush proposes, is all well and good, but it fails to deal with the underlying problem of ready access to weapons.

The White House will demonstrate that it is serious about addressing the problem only when it places the interests of this nation’s children ahead of the National Rifle Association and when it throws its weight behind meaningful federal gun control legislation. Jay N. Feldman
