To the Editor:

John Morgan (letter, April 30) writes that the National Rifle Association is working to avert Columbine High School-type disasters by offering training in the responsible use of firearms. Of course such training cuts down on accidents by teaching people how to handle and store firearms safely. Surely many lives have been saved by such training, but it will not prevent the premeditated misuse of firearms by people intending to kill. All that firearms training will do in such instances is increase the likelihood that the shooters will hit their targets more accurately.
