To the Editor:

Thomas L. Friedman (column, May 4) speculates that support for the war in Yugoslavia has waned because Americans are preoccupied with the tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.

But there is a much more direct source of ambivalence toward the war: from the beginning, the bombing has had exactly the opposite effect of what was intended. If there is a link between Kosovo and Columbine, it is that Americans are quite justifiably disgusted by senseless violence.
