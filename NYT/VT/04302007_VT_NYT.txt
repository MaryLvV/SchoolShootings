Re “After Virginia Tech, Testing Limits of Movie Violence” (Business Day, April 30):

So the horror film industry is worried about profits in light of the Virginia Tech massacre. But it doesn’t seem to have a problem of conscience, producing the stuff in the first place.

One would think that the daily body count in Iraq (or at home) would be enough horror for the American people, who are lured into theaters with poster images of torture and mutilation.

Does the film industry — which is populated by vociferously antiwar types — think the world needs more desensitization to violence?

Does Quentin Tarantino think man’s inhumanity to man — real or imagined — is acceptable?
