Re “The Morality Line” (column, April 19):

David Brooks makes the point about choice and responsibility: The killings at Virginia Tech happened at a moment “when background forces stop and individual choice” begins.

Not all troubled people act out violent fantasies; despite his apparent illness, Seung-Hui Cho made a choice in his soul somewhere along the line.

On the other hand, we as a society also have choices, including what kinds of weapons we allow in the marketplace that are easily available to the troubled when they make wrong choices — and that is our responsibility.

To the Editor:

David Brooks is right to suggest that any account of Seung-Hui Cho’s actions will have to assume that he made choices and exercised some degree of self-control in making them. But choices and self-control are complex processes with many underlying contributory factors — physiological, psychological and social.

Mr. Brooks laments the loss of free will in this explanatory mix, but what would we gain by adding it, other than a false sense of closure that some one person is morally to blame? How will this help us prevent similar actions in the future?

To the Editor:

David Brooks’s columns about the marvels of biology and evolution in explaining human behavior have been eye-opening. Yet he is wrong to dismiss the role of gun laws when it comes to the impact of violent actions.

One wonders why President Bush, who often speaks of the sanctity of life, has done so little to help protect our lives from gun violence.

To the Editor:

In arguing for a return to individual choice, free will and moral responsibility as we try to ponder the inexplicable behavior of Seung-Hui Cho, David Brooks misses the point. Whether Mr. Cho’s actions were determined by social forces outside his control or whether he had free will and was responsible for his behavior does not help us avert future tragedies.

In either case, he was a severely disturbed individual in need of help. We — his peers, his parents, his college, his world — had sufficient warning to intervene so as to protect others from his rage, irrespective of its source, as well as to protect him from himself.

To the Editor:

David Brooks argues that “individual choice and moral responsibility” need to be “closer to the center” of the debate about Seung-Hui Cho’s massacre at Virginia Tech. In doing so, he wisely acknowledges the evidence that some behavior is driven by forces that know no such control.

What also must be debated is the moral responsibility of social systems to protect society from Mr. Cho and Mr. Cho from himself. These systems failed, largely because of barriers to treating his mental illness.

They included laws that protected his rights against involuntary commitment and precluded college officials from discussing his situation with his parents.

Moreover, the community mental health system to which he was directed is broken.

Virginia has a severe shortage of acute-care mental hospital beds and waiting lists for mental health care. People with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other serious mental illnesses cannot get the care they need and often go to prison as a result. Where is the morality in that?

To the Editor:

David Brooks presents the dilemma between holding people morally accountable for their actions and the evidence of neuroscience that free will is only an illusion. But the ability of some people to rise above oppressive families and cultures to achieve great things represents a good practical substitute for free will.

Euclid, Newton, Darwin and Einstein all demonstrate the existence of some quality in humans that enables them to break free of the past and of their surroundings. We should remember them whenever we are tempted to think that someone’s failings, moral or otherwise, are fated.

To the Editor:

I agree with David Brooks when he says we need to “reconstruct some self-confident explanation for what happened at Virginia Tech that puts individual choice and moral responsibility closer to the center.”

But Seung-Hui Cho made such a choice. He chose to exercise his constitutional right to arm himself, and defend himself from what he perceived as his nemesis, a morally responsible action in his mind.

What we have not done is to construct a barrier to prevent such deluded people from taking advantage of the Second Amendment.

“Officials Knew Troubled State of Killer in ’05” (front page, April 19) reports that Cho Seung-Hui was allowed to continue as a student at Virginia Tech despite the fact that he had been determined to be mentally ill by a doctor and according to a judge’s order presented an imminent danger to himself or others.

So why was Mr. Cho allowed to buy a gun, given his obvious mental health problems?

If this country is not yet ready to outlaw guns outright, then at the very least stringent safeguards and background checks urgently need to be put in place that deny easy access to guns to people with severe mental imbalances. Mathias Frisch

Re “The Silence of Politicians” (editorial, April 19):

While I commend your editorial urging politicians to confront what you call “the runaway gun problem,” I see the only workable solution to putting a stop to more and more Columbine and Virginia Tech-type disasters is not for politicians to admit there is a problem but to repeal and rewrite the Second Amendment to the Constitution.

While it’s true that even the whisper of gun control causes politicians to run for cover, I believe that a groundswell can be built by those of us — and we are in the majority — who are appalled by what the rest of the civilized world sees as our Wild West heritage.

Yes, it’s time, at long last, to stop arguing over what the founding fathers meant by “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”

Instead, it’s time to write a sane national gun law that is right and proper for our nation in the 21st century. Allen M. Cobrin

To the Editor:

We are a nation in denial. Your editorial states that the Virginia Tech deaths “represent a mere tenth of 1 percent of the 30,000 gunshot deaths each year.”

The rate of gun deaths in 5- to 14-year-olds is 17 times higher in the United States than in 25 other developed countries combined.

In many school districts, teenagers tell me that they can get a gun as easily as a six-pack.

How many more young people will have to die before we demand that our gun laws be changed? Have we completely lost our moral compass?

Re “Package Forced NBC to Make Tough Decision” (news article, April 19):Why would any news organization broadcast the Virginia Tech killer’s made-for-infamy videos? Is there not a way to report the news without making those seeking infamy infamous? Thomas Eickhoff

Re “Korean-Americans Brace for Problems in Wake of Killings” (news article, April 19): If the killer had been white, we would not have seen the same kind of attention to his whiteness, nor would there be apologies from the white community.

In addition, the article mentioned how many Koreans have immigrated to America. The United States is a country entirely composed of immigrants in search of the American Dream; why is the Korean community being singled out because of the actions of one person?

The massacre at Blacksburg has caused pain, disbelief and sadness across the country. What must it be like to live in a community where massacres happen every day, day after day, killing men, women and children who, just like the students and the faculty at Virginia Tech, are just trying to live decent, kind lives?

Blacksburg and Baghdad are, for now, sister cities in mourning.

Re “The Portrait of a Gunman, and of a Society” (letters, April 19):

There were several good suggestions for ways to decrease the isolation, anger and humiliation felt by many in our society. I would like to add one.

There are classes required for graduating from high school; why not make psychology one of them? The introductory classes teach so much about human behavior that could help people to understand themselves and others, and to behave better toward one another.

By 16, most kids will have more information about how to operate a car than about their own psyche.

Lessons about how we make each other feel good or bad and how important these feelings are should begin in kindergarten; they are crucial to someday truly having a kinder and gentler nation. Zay Hartigan
