To the Editor:

Five children at the Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, Calif., are dead, and 29 others and a teacher lie wounded (front page, Jan. 18). But presumably the National Rifle Association can breathe easily because, after all, Patrick Purdy, a United States citizen, was not denied the right to bear arms.

And we as citizens permit this sort of thing. My question is this: are we all right? OWEN MCNAMARA Herkimer, N.Y., Jan. 19, 1989
