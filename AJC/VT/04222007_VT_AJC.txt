Virginia Tech massacre: With guns in mix, emotions take over
It's amazing the number of letter writers claiming that "if only everyone had a gun," Seung-Hui Cho might have been prevented from killing as many as he did. I will argue that may very well be the case. The downside of an ubiquitous gun-toting society is that all of the undiagnosed borderline sociopaths such as Cho would have those guns as well, which could only mean an increase in impulsive violent behavior.
Consider how many news reports we hear every week just in Atlanta about how a simple argument quickly escalated to guns being drawn. We have clear proof that when more people have guns, they will use them more as a means of quick emotional conflict resolution and far less for defensive needs.

Horror of senseless shooting captured
In an April 18 letter, the writer described as "sensational and deplorable" the headline "Bloodbath" on Page One of the April 17 newspaper.
My dictionary defines "blood bath" as "the killing of many people; massacre." What else could you call the senseless shooting at Virginia Tech?
I think the AJC headline captured the horror of the event perfectly. It certainly reflected the horror I felt when listening to the comments of those at the scene and seeing the pictures of the wounded being carried out of the building.
Perhaps the letter writer should check the dictionary before calling the headline "inconsiderate and flatly inaccurate."

30 slayings justify strong, vivid label
Let me get this straight: More than 30 people are shot to death and several others are wounded, and this is not sufficient carnage to be labeled a "bloodbath"?
Just how many people need to be shot and how much blood must be spilled to qualify for that distinction? Is 50 enough? Does it have to be at least 100?
If, as a society, we have become so inundated with gore by violence in our games, our movies and on the nightly news that a mere 30 deaths isn't enough to get all that excited about, then that is truly sad.

Bloodbath describes situation perfectly
I think the letter writer needs to review the definition of "blood bath." It does not require that one go "swashbuckling through the building, turning it into an animal slaughterhouse" nor does it require that "blood drips down from the 2nd floor."
It is irresponsible for the letter writer to attempt to reduce the magnitude of the crime to "bang, bang, ad nauseum." What happened in those classrooms to those teachers and children requires so much more than "bang, bang, ad nauseum."
If the writer does not believe that the murder of 32 people, the suicide of 1 and the wounding of 29 more is not a bloodbath, then that is what I find most disturbing. One can only imagine the scenes inside those classrooms. Death is not neat and tidy, and this reader thinks "bloodbath" said it all.

Laws wouldn't have stopped him
I don't know who I hold in greater contempt: the gun nuts who think that if only the faculty and student body of Virginia Tech had all been armed then none of this would have happened; or the anti-gun nuts who believe that if we only registered or banned guns, none of this would have happened.
To the former, if we become a more heavily armed society, a larger percentage of personal conflicts will become fire fights.
To the latter, anyone willing to break the law against murder, 32 times, is willing to obtain a gun illegally.
Bad things happen. Passing legislation or packing heat will not change that.

Why lawfully allow semi-automatics?
Does anyone believe that the framers of our Constitution could have foreseen the day when firearm magazine capacities and rates of fire would make events such as the shootings at Virginia Tech possible? In their day, a trained marksman might be able to fire a flintlock weapon three or four times a minute as opposed to today's semi-automatic weapons that can fire that many in a second.
Gun proponents who favor a "strict constructionist" (that is "what the framers really had in mind") interpretation of the Second Amendment aren't being intellectually honest when they contend that their unfettered rights extend to these types of weapons.

Changes in security, media coverage needed in wake of shootings
The aftermath of the Virginia college massacre leaves me with several concerns.
First, the finger-pointing relative to gun availability leaves me shaking with the thought of thousands of hungover teenage college students becoming loose-cannon Rambos. A sound solution to college safety relative to gun availability would be to allow professors who obtain gun permits to keep a firearm in a locked classroom desk drawer for use in emergencies.
The manner in which students are alerted to possible danger needs refinement. I suggest a three-phased sequence. First, a campus-wide siren is sounded followed immediately by a public address system announcement. This should be followed up with an e-mail message. The first two steps should be repeated every 15 minutes until the danger has passed.
The massive media coverage, which was precisely what this nut-case wanted, was overdone in a big way -- especially the graphic coverage of the video he sent to NBC. Fox News was going nonstop on this for three days now. This only serves to encourage copycats to attempt to set a new "record."
Last of all, if colleges have the right to accept or reject applicants, they should have greater latitude in expelling problem students without violating their so-called "privacy" rights.

Before we 'stay awake,' we must first wake up, reach out
I enjoyed Rick Badie's column ("Let's stay awake after this nightmare" AJC Gwinnett News, April 18) regarding the Virginia Tech tragedy. I really resonated with his sound wisdom to reach out to those who, for whatever reason, have a difficult time fitting in.
I remember going to a workshop with an author who wrote about parenting, and he said the single most important thing to help our kids was to help them foster at least one meaningful friendship. With just one true friend, you can weather a lot of storms. More important than good grades, than being popular, than being athletic is just one good friend.
I feel sad that Cho Seung-Hui didn't have that friend and instead resorted to a tragic expression of his pain.
To "stay awake," we have to "wake up" first. I don't hear many voices, such as Mr. Badie's, trying to address the roots of this problem -- to reach out to those in pain instead of avoiding, ignoring, ridiculing, or even punishing them. It's difficult to have compassion for someone when they are sending out "leave me alone" signals, but the world is full of people starving for some understanding and empathy. And too often, the only way they feel understood, the only action they know to take to get the empathy they yearn for (often unconsciously) is to inflict pain on someone else.
I hope we can wake up and see how choosing support vs. judgment of others can help ease their pain so that they don't have to take such drastic steps to be heard. One way I've found that has helped me better understand why people do the violent things they do and has given me hope that I can transform violence is a process called Nonviolent Communication (www.cnvc.org). If we could learn to speak to and be with each other in this way, we would have a better chance of reaching someone who is on the brink of a desperate act.

I openly wept when I learned about the massacre at Virginia Tech. I don't remember the last time I openly wept, but it did happen on Monday.
As a freshman at the University of Georgia, I watched Columbine unfold as well as the other tragic shootings across the country. Now, as a high school teacher in both public and private schools, I can say that the problem is far from over.
It is obvious to a younger observer (I'm 26) that the same teens humming the unity anthems in Disney's "High School Musical" are the same kids who heap social pressures on others.
When is society going to evolve from this petty Edith Wharton-esque social system? Who will write the novel, set the example, or just change the way we all look at each other?
There has to be a better way than this.
