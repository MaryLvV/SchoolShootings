Koreans need not apologize
Koreans have expressed their sincere apology for the actions of Seung-Hui Cho. Some Korean have taken his actions personally by apologizing and expressing a sense of guilt. Why should we apologize for the actions of a single maniac? Instead, Korean Americans need to express their sincere condolences and pray for the victims' families. We should not be ashamed nor express apology for our Korean heritage.
