The shootings at Columbine High School have revived the saying, "Guns don't kill people; people kill people." It is not guns that kill people, nor is it simply people who kill people. Each of the perpetrators in each of the school killings over the past several years has been male. If we want to be precise we should be admitting, "Guns don't kill people; boys and men kill people." There is danger in speaking globally of the "teenagers" who have been involved in school shootings, overlooking the gendered nature of this phenomenon. To do so will blind us from examining those cultural influences that perpetuate violence as a meaningful outlet for boys but not for girls.
We cannot begin to gain insight into these acts until they are seen and defined as a gendered problem tied to cultural representations of what it means to be a man.
