In response to the violent tragedy at Columbine High School, President Clinton quoted the New Testament and suggested that we Americans pray for the families of the murdered and injured students. If these young people who committed this crime had grown up with prayer in the school, freedom to read the Bible in school and the Ten Commandments on display, these murders would not have taken place. There are numerous causes for these killings. One is the American Civil Liberties Union and its legal challenges against the Judeo-Christian concepts upon which our country was formed. Another is parents too willing to sue the school systems so that the teachers and principals no longer have the authority to discipline the youths entrusted to their care.
The lack of Judeo-Christian family values caused these young people to turn on their fellow students. Also to blame is the violent nature of the entertainment industry.

NRA ignores truth

Perhaps National Rifle Association President Charlton Heston would like fly to Denver and explain to the faculty, students and parents of the students at Columbine High School just how important it is for Americans to have guns. The NRA tries to get a lot out of its simplistic, and empty rhethoric, but the truth is simple: Guns let people kill people, and allow them to do it most efficiently. This adherence to the letter, and not the intent, of the 2nd Amendment is a greater threat to our liberty.

The Littleton, Colo., attack prompted many metro Atlantans to express their opinions online. Here's a sampling of comments from an Access Atlanta forum. "The real tragedy of this event is that it could have been prevented. This society is extremely selfish. We would rather own guns for the sake of 'freedom' than save lives. We will always have insane people in this world who will kill. In this case, if guns were not so easily available, the killers may have thought twice."
"Why is it whenever a tragedy happens, everyone wants to blame the guns? What object would people blame if the guns had been left at home and the boys had used machetes to kill people?"
"I hear what you are saying. . . . However, at least you have a better chance of escaping if someone has a knife. "
"First I would like to start off by saying that we should have a moment of silence for the students at Columbine High School. It was such a tragedy that things like this are starting to happen on a regular basis. It's not the poor kids or ghetto kids who are doing this but middle-class children. You have to start wondering what kind of job the parents are doing."
"This tragic situation could only have been prevented at home. Modern society dictates that we should ignore our children, spend more time at work and make more money. We, as parents, choose to justify these actions by saying that we do it all to provide a more stable or better lifestyle for our children. Parents, what our children need the most is attention, affection and to matter to someone. Wake up, America! Your children matter more than your boss, your finances, your ego, your social status and your sex lives."
"I am going to offend a lot of people here, but I am a very upset black individual. White people tell us that we should get over what has happened in the past. How can you do so when you have what happened in Texas with the dragging death of a black person and what happened at Littleton, Colo.?
"White people, get a grip. The laws in this country were all created mostly by white people, and I feel that you are starting to reap what you sow. You need to do a better job in talking about racism with your kids."
