A stunned and bewildered nation shakes its head in shock over the recent shootings at Columbine High School. In this tragedy, 15 people died. Every day in the United States, more than 4,000 unborn youngsters are annihilated in abortion clinics. While not minimizing the tragic events in Colorado, proper perspective must be given to the death toll. The recent outrage of Littleton only magnifies the moral absurdity of a greater holocaust of children who never even stepped into a school building.
