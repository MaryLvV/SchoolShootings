Although I am outraged at the senseless murder of students who attended Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., I am equally outraged that Bill Clinton has decided that it is appropriate to use $1.5 million taken by force from taxpayers to pay for funeral expenses in Littleton ("U.S. to help with $1.5 million," April 24). Since when has it become a proper function of this government to pay for funerals brought about by random acts of senseless violence? This is just another stunt pulled by Clinton to show how much he "cares" about the citizens. His gesture would have a great deal more meaning if he spent his own money and not dollars plundered through taxes.
