It shouldn't take a panel of experts to understand the growing problem of violence committed by children and teenagers. They are continuously indoctrinated via film, television, computer games, rap music and comic books that the way to settle "scores" is by physical violence and guns. It has been going on with increased intensity since the 1970s. When are we going to focus on the entertainment media to lay off the violence in their programs? Perhaps it will take more killings such as those at Columbine High School.

Fix parents first

Much of the conversation after the Columbine High School massacre centers on feelings that parents need to help their children discuss their feelings. The notion is that these conversations will help parents discover and defuse their children's underlying anger and resentment early on and eliminate or decrease the type of horrible episode that occurred in Littleton. What's wrong with this picture? We are talking about a generation of parents who have repressed and suppressed their feelings with Valium, Prozac, alcohol and a myriad of other chemicals for years, if not decades, while giving their children all the toys and freedom they wanted so the parents could focus on their own "well-being."
Unfortunately, there is no quick fix. Parents will need first to get in touch with themselves as individuals before they can support their children to open up and relate. Children will need emotional support that many of their parents are incapable of providing.
Not until these parents move from denial and engage in their own personal development will they build a foundation for effective parent-child relationships.
