To help head off a horrible tragedy in Georgia like the one that occurred at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., Gov. Roy Barnes and members of the Legislature should look into the highly successful "Regional Safe Schools Program." The program is state-funded in Illinois and has been tested in Chicago public schools for four years. Under this program, youngsters on the verge of expulsion or suspension are placed in regional schools, where psychiatrists, sociologists and therapists help them overcome violent tendencies and teach them how to modify their behavior.
At the same time, these youngsters continue their academic education in classes of five to eight students. By the end of 1998, 4,631 students had been enrolled in these alternative schools.
Shelia Radford-Hill, division administrator of the Illinois Board of Education, says that more than 80 percent of of the students who entered the program showed encouraging results. Students obtained academic credit, advanced in grade and, in some cases, graduated from elementary or high school or obtained a GED and moved on to post-secondary training, the U.S. armed forces or a job. "These are significant positive results for students who otherwise might have ended their educational careers and/or seriously disrupted the normal classrooms," she reported.
In Chicago schools, members of the "Trench Coat Mafia" would have been sent -- at the first signs of potential violence -- to the alternate schools for help.
Barnes and the Georgia Legislature should consider emulating this successful program.
