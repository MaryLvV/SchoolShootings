In the days after the massacre at the high school in Littleton, Colo., I observed the varying reactions of "mainstream" America and noticed things that bewilder, if not anger, African-Americans who live with life-threatening conditions every day. In the midst of the understandable outrage of millions of Americans over the tragedy were two stories equally as tragic. In two separate murder cases here, 17-year old black kids are the defendants. One was accused of gunning down a 13-year-old student and the other was charged with killing a teacher in Inman Park.
Murder and mayhem are omnipresent in black communities across this land. Drive through any poor, inner-city neighborhood and you assuredly will find a juvenile with access to the type of weapons used in the Columbine shootings.
Yet, gun violence only becomes an issue of epidemic proportions to white America when it creeps outside the boundaries of the ghetto. Is this because young black men are so often portrayed as undisciplined, violence-prone individuals? Or is it that black lives are valued less?
People and media are desperately searching for someone to blame for the senseless violence in Colorado. Parents, the National Rifle Association, movies, and even cartoons are being attacked by the same folks who have turned a blind eye to the "epidemic" of violence that has existed in the black neighborhoods for decades.
One tragedy is no greater than the other. Innocent lives are lost to evil thinkers and doers. Let's hope we all will take a little more notice when gun violence occurs, no matter where.
