Many of the articles, columns and editorials published by the Journal-Constitution in the past week skillfully point out key issues confronting us as we seek explanations for the carnage in Colorado. Here's my take: It is not the music (Marilyn Manson), the books ("The Eye of the World"), the movies ("Basketball Diaries"), television shows, the Internet or computer video games. These are superficial means through which troubled people identify and express their personal angst and anger. The cause is that very angst and anger, often unrecognized by the people experiencing it or by their friends and family.
One article, apparently paraphrasing a counselor, stated, "Students warned regularly about drugs and alcohol need to be trained just as vigorously in recognizing depression and dealing with anger" ("What turns teen angst into tragedy," April 22).
That's exactly right.
