The Columbine High School massacre baffles our minds and breaks our hearts. The school is situated in a middle-class community that embodies the American dream of our forefathers. That dream was shattered by gunfire, explosive and bleeding bodies. This calamity did not happened in tough, crowded Brooklyn or hot, turbulent Los Angeles. It happened in clean-shaven, white-collar America. How can this be? Some argue that only a small percentage of children would commit such an atrocity, that by and large our schools are safe. Try telling this to the parents of the victims. How peculiar that this land of plenty could produce such destructive and despairing individuals.
Society has always had its share of lunatics, criminals and lowlifes. However, these perpetrators were mere children. What is especially alarming is the magnitude of their anger directed at society. Such wrath can only be attributed to their own distorted sense of self-hatred.
There seems to be a gross inability to shrug off life's trivial insults. A social slight is magnified into a rejection of grotesque proportion, and like a rolling snowball, hatred grows until it is all-consuming. Is this a malfunction of brain chemistry? Could the school have foreseen tragedy? Are the parents to blame?
Everyone is responsible for making our society work. The schools must provide armed security. We must curtail the proliferation of guns. Unless we do something meaningful to heed this most recent cry for help, we will be hearing its dreadful echo in the future.
