I am writing to urge you not to exploit the recent murders at Virginia Tech as justification for additional, so-called "gun control" legislation. Some members of Congress are already calling for new laws that will infringe upon the right of law-abiding citizens to own firearms for self-defense. The emphasis must be on preventing criminals or the mentally ill from obtaining "any" firearm. In contrast, laws that ban certain guns or types of guns are obeyed only by citizens who obey all other laws, not by criminals. They do nothing to reduce crime or eliminate its causes. Law-abiding citizens have a right to armed self-defense, and self-defense is a basic human right. Criminals will always have access to guns and other weapons. Disarming innocent citizens is unsound public policy and it is fundamentally immoral.
Wouldn't we all be safer if every psychologically fit adult American with no criminal record were to carry at all times an easily concealable, easily obtainable semiautomatic handgun?
The measurable difference between a "moody artist" and a student who is "truly disturbed" is the gun. How many more school shootings will it take for this country to wake up and finally ban handguns?
Massacres, along with racism, sexism, war and poverty, will never stop. That is the cost of being imperfect human beings. Compassion never stops either. So all we humans can do is to work as hard as we can to stop these very evils. That is the human dilemma.
