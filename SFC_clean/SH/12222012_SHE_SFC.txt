I think we should take a sober, open-minded look at arming school officials. Schools are one of the few places shooters can enter without fear of armed resistance. The brave principal at Sandy Hook lunged at Adam Lanza but was shot down; if she had been able to point a loaded gun at him, the outcome might have been different. Classroom teachers should probably not be armed, but one or more of the administrative staff could be, with a gun kept safely in the office. This would require such persons to be both able and willing to accept the responsibility. I believe many would.
Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, has now called for stationing armed guards at all of the schools in the country. Will the NRA's friends in the Tea Party give enthusiastic support to raising the needed taxes? Or will they simply propose the complete elimination of Social Security to pay for it?
Someone please explain to me how the NRA's plan to put armed guards in every school in the nation will protect anyone at a mall, movie theater, library, church; etc. - or from another nut with an assault weapon.
It is time to repeal the Second Amendment. As a society we have proven that we are unable to cope with the rights and responsibilities of bearing arms. Gun owners will suggest their freedom is being taken away. How about the freedom to attend first grade, go to a movie theater, shop at a mall? Senseless acts of gun violence occur every day in this country and consequently gun owners have forfeited their rights.
When pizzas are outlawed, only outlaws will have pizza. When broccoli is outlawed, only outlaws will have broccoli. When sex is outlawed, only outlaws will have sex. Does everyone see how idiotic this statement is now?
