What will it take?At some point in American history, we decided that slavery was wrong, despite the fact that our Founding Fathers owned slaves. At some point in our history, we decided that women should be able to vote, despite the fact that our Founding Fathers didn't give women the vote. At some point in our history, we decided that black people should be able to vote, despite the fact our Founding Fathers didn't think so. At some point in our history, we decided that it was wrong to take land from Native Americans, despite the fact that our Founding Fathers didn't really care about that. So what will it take for Americans to start accepting the idea that, despite what our Founding Fathers thought, guns no longer have a place in the hands of private citizens in a free country, where everyone has the inalienable right to live without the fear of getting shot? How many more children must die? It's not just Sandy Hook, or Columbine or Virginia Tech. It's also the 10 children who die daily from guns. And the thousands more who survive gunshots and are maimed and disabled for life.
