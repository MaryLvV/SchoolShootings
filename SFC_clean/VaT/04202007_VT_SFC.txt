I never thought I would praise Debra J. Saunders and Jon Carroll in the same letter, for the same reason: I applaud their taking the screaming media to task in their April 19 columns for exploiting the Virginia Tech tragedy. Your April 18 headline, "A nation asks why" was just silly. A nation grieves, but if it keeps asking why, it is wasting its time. We know the immediate reasons why: A crazy person used a gun. Because we are never going to get rid of either crazy people or guns, the deeper reasons do not matter. Really, they don't. His video does not matter. Opinions of others don't matter. The feelings of the people directly affected by the tragedy do matter, but is it going to make them feel better to have the details endlessly rehashed in the media? I think not. Try this: Refrain, from now on, from putting the tragedy on the front page. I dare you.
