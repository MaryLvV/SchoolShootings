Re the May 1 article, "Green stickers point way to help at Cal" -- I think it's a wonderful idea to try to identify troubled students before they can endanger themselves or others, and provide them with the help they need. I'm a sophomore at California High School and I frequently see students off somewhere by themselves, and I just assume they're shy. After the incident at Virginia Tech, it's become clear to me that there's a fine line between introversion and mental disturbance. This is why I think it'd be a great idea not only to implement this "Look for the Signs" program in colleges, but in high schools as well. High school is a tough time in a teen's life, and the root of future problems is often planted then. If every student in school could identify signs of depression or internal outrage and knew how to react accordingly, I have no doubt that this would lower the chances of another attack like this occurring. I've spent nearly all of my elementary and middle school years learning how to say no to drugs in D.A.R.E. I know how to resist peer pressure, and how to look out for my own well-being. Now I think it's time we learn to look out for the well-being of others, because that will often determine yours.
