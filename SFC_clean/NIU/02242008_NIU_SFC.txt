Every time I hear of another senseless shooting like the one at Northern Illinois University, these lyrics come to mind: "How many deaths will it take till he knows that too many people have died?" The guns are not doing the killing, the people using the guns are. What do they have in common? They are on or have just gone off anti-depressant drugs. Have you ever read the side effects of these drugs? Probably not unless reading 25 pages of medical jargon is something you enjoy (pi.lilly.com/us/cymbalta-pi.pdf). Families are alerted of the need to monitor daily the behavior of anyone on these drugs, yet how do you monitor someone who "seems normal" like Steven Kazmierczak's girlfriend said of him up until the day he killed innocent people as well as himself? When will we decide "too many people have died?"
