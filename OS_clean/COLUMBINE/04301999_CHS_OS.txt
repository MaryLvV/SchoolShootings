MAUREEN DOWD'S April 27 column does a disservice to Dowd, the tragic events at Columbine High School and the objects of her displeasure - the National Rifle Association, Charlton Heston and what they represent. Through her acerbic and misdirected attack on Heston's letter, Dowd clearly exposes herself as part of the problem. To suggest that she's "conveying what Heston must really think" is disrespectful and incredibly insensitive, given the contents of Heston's letter. Dowd's kind of insensitivity is at the very core of what's wrong with this country today. Our inability to disagree without being disagreeable, vicious attacks on innocent bystanders and disrespect of (much less insensitivity toward) diverse viewpoints polarize this nation's body politic, coarsen the culture and crush the country's spirit. I wish Dowd would use her considerable talents to heal our wounds, not tear at them.
