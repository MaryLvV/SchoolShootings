Let us be realistic. Firearms were not the reason for the Virginia Tech tragedy. They were the tools of choice by a mentally disturbed individual. Crime and tragedy cannot be averted by laws against objects. Anyone intelligent enough to get accepted into a prestigious school like VT is also intelligent enough to utilize other destructive devices. Perhaps even more deadly. In New York state, I had to meet stringent requirements to obtain a concealed-carry permit. In many cities, requirements are even stricter. These laws have not decreased criminal incidents. There is nothing wrong when responsible individuals rely on a forearm for protection of life and safety. I believe the news media add to the problem of individuals committing tragic events when they portray people as Rambo-type heroes. A prime example is the video left by the murderer. These people should be described as deranged and disgusting, in need of our pity. When the media present tragedy as a spectacular event that initiates "copy cat" activity, there is no outcry about curbing freedom of the press. The terrible misuse of a firearm should not be used to curb our freedom of self-protection and sportsmanship.
