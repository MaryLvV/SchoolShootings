A story in Saturday's Sentinel says that "police are losing sleep" over the fear of never finding a cause of the Virginia Tech tragedy. In their search for answers, they are interviewing students and faculty who crossed Seung-Hui Cho's path in college.  As a lifelong teacher, I can tell you that they are looking in the wrong place. The students and faculty of the college have neither the answer nor any part in the responsibility for his actions. By the time he reached college, the damage had already been done.  It was in elementary, middle and high school where he was subjected to abuse and humiliation and learned it was better not to speak than to have your speech ridiculed by peers. So he retreated into a "hole." It was there that his pain grew into insane rage.  The only positive thing that can come from the profound grief and loss we all feel is a knowledge of the power of bullying on a human being. And, from that knowledge, teachers, students and parents must act on the belief that the child who seems least worthy of our love is the one who needs it most.  Enforce the message of empathy that everybody has feelings and hopefully we can stop someone like Cho from ever becoming mentally ill.
