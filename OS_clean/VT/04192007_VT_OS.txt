As a retired police lieutenant and former campus police chief, I was totally revolted by the headlines of the April 17 edition, "Where was security?" and in huge block letters "WHY WASN'T HE STOPPED?" "Where was security?" Virginia Tech has a total of 40 police officers, spread over three shifts, meaning that each shift likely has only eight to 10 officers on duty at any given time, covering a campus of 2,600 acres with 26,370 students. Undoubtedly, most of those officers on duty were deeply occupied investigating the first double homicide at the dormitory when the second shooting occurred.  "Why wasn't he stopped?" In order for that to happen, the officers would have needed to know exactly who "he" was! Should they have stopped every single person found traversing the campus, illegally searching them for possible weapons? The two handguns used by the killer could very easily be concealed; it is highly unlikely that he crossed the campus openly brandishing them. Did the officers perhaps forget to bring their crystal balls so they could know without any doubt who the killer was and that he was going to strike again?  The Sentinel has not resorted to such irresponsible headlines when addressing the record number of murders in Orlando and Orange County last year, a trend that is continuing this year. Doing so in this horribly tragic case displays a total lack of understanding of the fact that law enforcement operates under enormous legal restrictions, and it cannot be everywhere at all times.  You have done a grave disservice to law enforcement everywhere.
