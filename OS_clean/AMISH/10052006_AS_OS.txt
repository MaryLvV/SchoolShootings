I was born and raised in the Amish area, and I am deeply saddened by the shootings at the Nickel Mines Amish School in Pennsylvania. The Amish are a very religious sect embracing God and peace. The Amish migrated to Pennsylvania to avoid European religious persecution and compulsory military service. They grow no mustaches because this was a symbol of Prussian military men. They loathe violence in any form. The Amish are very generous and kind and would help anyone in need. However, Charles Carl Roberts IV invaded the Amish's peaceful sanctuary bent on molestation and brutality. According to Wednesday's article, Roberts "confessed in suicide notes to sexually molesting two young relatives 20 years ago and to having recurring dreams about hurting children again" -- far from the "loving," "exceptional father" portrayed by his wife. School shootings should be reclassified as federal crimes, and all available resources should be utilized to prosecute these heinous criminals. The Amish community has forgiven Roberts for his monstrous acts. Unlike any group of people in the world, the Amish harbor no hatred or ill will toward anyone, including those who have done grave harm to them. If more Americans embraced Amish values, America would be a much better country.
