Stop tragedies - fund issues

The action of one person at Virginia Tech is more than a tragic and horrendous incident - it is a warning.

Until adequate funding to help citizens with mental illnesses and meaningful gun control happen, we cannot be surprised when more tragic incidents occur.

Are you listening, legislators? Aren't you working on mental-health funding right now?
