Media wrong to play into hands of a bloody killer

The decision of NBC News and other broadcast organizations to air portions of Cho Seung-Hui's video rant is disappointing, unnecessary and potentially dangerous. We know from his horrific actions that Cho was a madman; the viewing public does not need to see videotaped proof of his lunacy. Nor do the victims' survivors need to watch on television the rage their loved ones saw as they died.

Cho was sane enough to know that video clips mailed to one of the major networks would bombard the airwaves. The motive behind his shooting rampage, undoubtedly, was to gain infamy. Why grant him this wish?

The power of the media is undeniable, and airing video manifestos like Cho's may only encourage other disturbed individuals to implement their own perverse, deadly plots.

Let's focus instead on the lives of the 32 individuals who died so one crackpot could make the evening news. When the history of the Virgina Tech massacre is written, Cho Seung-Hui should be nothing more than a footnote.

A simple precaution

I believe that the massacre at Virginia Tech calls for universities to take immediate action to help ensure the safety of students and employees. I suggest that universities with large geographic areas use a siren system with a unique sound to warn people on the campus if a shooting or violent crime has occurred.
