I am heart-sick over the massacre of 20 precious, defenseless first-graders and six employees at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

One would have thought locked doors and a buzzer system to be adequate security. But it wasn't; the shooter got in. He opened fire with an automatic rifle, inflicting multiple wounds in each victim, in one as many as 11 wounds.

Is it not time we stop letting our nation be bullied by the NRA, gun manufacturers, dealers and lobbyists and insist on some sensible regulation of firearms? What citizen needs an assault rifle, or a hand gun with magazine capacity of more than 6 to 10 bullets? And is it too much to ask that there be sensible regulation on who is allowed to own a gun? Not everyone is mentally, emotionally or morally equipped to safely be allowed to have a lethal weapon.

Regulation, of course, will not end violence, but surely that is no excuse for not trying to control it.

I am so proud of the teachers and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut for all they did to protect their students. I am proud of all teachers everywhere for what they do every day to teach and protect their students.
