Cal Thomas in his Oct. 5 column counts three fatal school shootings in just one month ("No Safe Places"). He believes that the killings in the seemingly safe Amish school are further evidence that schooling children at home is a way for parents to better ensure their safety. There are lots of good reasons for home schooling, but Thomas' makes no sense. Has he paid attention to the murders, abuse and other domestic violence that take place in American homes? I suspect that schools are actually safer places for children than many of their homes.
