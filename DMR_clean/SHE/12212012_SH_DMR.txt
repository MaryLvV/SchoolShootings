People are asking, why did the Sandy Hook shootings happen? The real answer is, we let crazy people have access to military-grade guns. Why? The reason crazy people get access to military-grade weapons is because America is about money, not about protecting children. The gun industry donates mass sums of money to get members of Congress elected so that they can make sure they get to sell guns. Just like the tobacco companies buy off Congress so that they can market addictive poison. As long as we put money first, then children are going to be gunned down by crazy people. The only way that we can change that is to do like we did last election and turn away from candidates who have big money behind them. As long as we are too lazy to vote smart then we will have to get used to having our children slaughtered to protect corporate profits of the gun lobby.
