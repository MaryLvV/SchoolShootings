"Military-Style Rifles Not a Problem" was the title of a recent letter on these pages. The writer was absolutely correct. Like him, I am a veteran, too, and I find it disgusting that certain politicians are willing to send young people into harm's way with guns capable of full auto then do not trust them with semi-automatic when they take off the uniform. They use a tragedy like the Sandy Hook shootings to go after the law-abiding citizens, including veterans, to restrict the right to bear arms. Remember, rights are not granted by government. Government can only restrict your ability to exercise your rights. Sad, attempts are always under way in America to do just that by people who enjoy the benefit of 24/7 armed security.
