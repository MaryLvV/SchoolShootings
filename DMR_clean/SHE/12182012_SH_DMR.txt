Our nation has now suffered another violent act perpetuated on our most vulnerable, our children at Sandy Hook Elementary. When is it going to be enough? The outrage should be loud and resounding throughout our country.

We must not let this moment pass without demanding a change in our gun laws. It is time for the National Rifle Association to work with our leaders from both parties to handle this issue as if it is a life and death one, because that is exactly what it is.

We cannot and must not allow our country to be defined as one that thinks more about our guns than we do our citizens.

Tomorrow another 30 people will lose their lives to gun violence in the United States. And the next day will follow with the same sickening statistics. We are the most heavily armed nation in the world and account for 80 percent of gun deaths among the 23 richest countries combined. Why? If having a heavy arsenal of guns makes you safer, then why do we have the highest rate of deaths?

When will we say enough? How many more innocent victims will lose their lives as we complain and walk around in utter disbelief? The time is now and the citizens, yes you and me, must demand a change in our gun laws, and let our elected officials know that we mean business and will not listen to any more nonsense about the difficulty of working with gun rights activists and the NRA. The last time I checked, this was the United States of America, not the United States of the NRA.
