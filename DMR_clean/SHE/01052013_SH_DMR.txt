Bob Dill, the publisher of the Greenville, S.C., Times Examiner, neglected to read the list of victims in the Newtown, Conn., massacre. He laments ("Gun-Free School Zones Create Easy Targets for Killers," Jan. 3) an America that has chosen "to replace God with humanistic psychology." Among the adults gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School was Mary Sherlach, the school psychologist. Unarmed, she ran at the gunman to try to save the children. She is a hero. So, Dill should dig a little deeper in his research and maybe a little deeper in his heart.
