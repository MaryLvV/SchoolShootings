What is ironic to many of us who value the sanctity of life, we wonder how this president and so many of his minions can weep openly for the victims [in Connecticut] and their families, but can cavalierly support and encourage the murder of thousands of children in the womb every day while shedding nary a tear. Is that what is meant by the expression, "shedding crocodile tears"?
