The nation mourned the loss of 20 innocent children and six of their teachers and administrators at Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14. We prayed for all those involved, while the politicians and the media immediately blamed the NRA and the Second Amendment in an attempt to take away our rights while grabbing more power for themselves. More intelligent thinkers quickly suggested a broader problem with no simple solutions. They included our violent culture, breakdown of the family and religion, drugs and mental illness as contributing factors. Violence has become our answer to everything we dislike. Minor bar disagreements turn deadly with the help of alcohol or drugs. Thousands are killed over illegal drug profits and territories. Families don't raise their children or teach them anything. Instead of answering to a higher power, it has become survival of the fittest, and that is where guns come in. Guns are not the problem, but they are seen as the solution to our crumbling society. As terrible and senseless as the Newtown massacre was, just remember this: Parents kill 1.25 million innocent newborn children every year in this country alone. Maybe our culture of violence begins with abortion.
