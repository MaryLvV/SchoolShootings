NRA should disavow remark about guns

The National Rifle Association has sunk to a new low by suggesting that teachers be allowed to have weapons in schools ("NRA Leader: Look at All Options for Keeping Schools Safe," March 26). This outrageous, irresponsible and idiotic statement was attributed to Sandra Froman, first vice president of the NRA, shortly after the tragic school shootings in Red Lake, Minn.

Guns are not the answer to social problems and certainly will not help troubled youth deal with estrangement from peers and the feelings of being different. I cannot imagine even the most ardent hunters or gun collectors being in favor of turning schools into killing fields.

Easy access to guns is part of the horror of school shootings. More guns could only compound the problem.

I call on the leadership of the NRA to disavow the statements by Froman and to reprimand her for her recklessness.
