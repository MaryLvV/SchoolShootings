A week after the violence, the Amish have cleared the site of the building and planted various grasses and clover to return the site to pastureland. What a contrast to another site of violence, ground zero, where the bickering and gawking continue five years later. Perhaps it�s as simple as the vast difference in the value of the two sites financially, but the Amish seem to have the right values about moving on. Susan J. Behrens
