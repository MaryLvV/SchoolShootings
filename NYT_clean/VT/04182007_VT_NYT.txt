The tragedy at Virginia Tech and discussions of Cho Seung-Hui�s behavior as a student make it clear that, as a society, we cannot accurately identify and predict who will commit murder, nor are we able to effectively intervene in advance. The obvious solution is strict controls on handguns so that individuals do not have the means to commit such atrocities. This requires legislators to have the courage to stand up to the powerful pro-gun organizations, which � through a combination of propaganda, financial and political influence � made it possible for a man to simply walk into a gun store and buy a 9-millimeter handgun on the spot.

Cho Seung-Hui did not emerge in our world full grown with guns blazing. He has been with us a long time. He was a child in our school systems. He was a person in our community, in our mental health system. He was part of a family. Instead of rushing to fight a gun lobby that will not move one inch, what about finding ways to help the young, desperate, angry, isolated and miserable among us? That means money for early childhood education, parent education, mental health and school counselors. Ways that we can intervene in the lives of the disassociated young before it is so tragically too late.
Are there really people who believe that if there were more guns on campuses there would be fewer shootings and less violence? The logic is so perverted that if it were not so tragic it would be funny. I wonder how many students at Virginia Tech today would like the campus rules relaxed so that more students could carry a weapon? I am guessing that the vast majority would prefer the rules to be better enforced so that no one can enter a campus building with any kind of weapon. Alison Nicholls
My sincere condolences go to the families who are in deep mourning over losing their loved ones. When the news broke that the gunman was a 23-year-old Korean immigrant, I was in total shock. As a Korean-American, I never thought or imagined that this type of crime could be done by a Korean. My heart is trembling with grief, and my head is still filled with pictures of devastation. I just want to reach out to the mourning families and tell them how sorry I am and that I am grieving, too.
