Virginia Polytechnic Institute�s students and faculty will forever be changed after the massacre on April 16, 2007. College students around the country are shocked and horrified. In 2002, a man shot four people, including two professors, at my school, the University of Arizona. Although the attack in Virginia was more a massacre than a shooting, students experience a similar gut-wrenching feeling as they realize that their college campus is a vulnerable environment. Campuses are not as safe as in the past. We constantly hear about sexual assaults, rapes and even shootings on our campuses. I, for one, am worried about the possible increases in danger that threaten future college students if schools do not maintain a safer environment.
How many mass shootings, how much loss, how much grief will it take before our legislators are finally willing to stand up to the National Rifle Association and pass meaningful gun control legislation? The University of Texas shooting more than 40 years ago, Columbine High School in 1999 and now Virginia Tech. Isn�t that enough tragedy to impel action? The majority of Americans support gun control. What do we have to do to make it happen?
In �Eight Years After Columbine� (editorial, April 17), you call for more gun control. With 40 states permitting law-abiding citizens to carry handguns for protection, the evidence teaches that prohibiting carrying such weapons leads to tragedy. Virginia Tech is one of the �gun free� zones in Virginia where gun possession is prohibited � a place criminals know that they need not fear an armed response. The prohibition did not stop the gunman, but it did prevent anyone on that campus from stopping his murder spree.
Interesting. Your first reaction to the Virginia Tech shooting (editorial, April 17) is to increase gun control. My first reaction was, �I wish there were more kids in that school who had a concealed carry license and a firearm to protect themselves.� Here in Vermont, we have the fewest gun restrictions of any state in the Union and the third lowest rate for violent crime. So is your way really better? Is there really convincing data to show that restricting firearms reduces violence? Or is it just the opposite? Making firearms accessible to lawful citizens actually decreases violence. If you were living and working in Iraq or Israel right now, and you were concerned about your safety and that of your family, would you want your firearm taken away from you? I don�t think so.
Why is it that my phone company can call me with a text message to let me know that my bill is due, but universities that charge thousands of dollars a year in tuition can only send an e-mail message warning students to stay at home? Emergency notifications should be sent to student cellphones in the form of a call or a text message that rings. Every college professor and parent knows that students rarely check e-mail and are glued to their phones every waking minute. If such a system had been in place at Virginia Tech, dozens of lives may have been saved.
Surely every campus should have a loud alert siren that could be set off in the case of a shooting or any other peril.
It was shocking to hear Virginia Tech officials say they did not shut down the campus in response to the first shooting because they believed that it was just a domestic quarrel. It sounds as if they are accustomed to domestic quarrels on the campus�s being settled by shootings and they are therefore not worthy of anyone�s attention. What kind of an excuse was that?
I urge the American people to work through the tragedy at Virginia Tech to begin an honest and open discourse about mental health in our country, especially on our college campuses. During my senior year of school, a young woman committed suicide on campus. These shootings and suicides illuminate the fact that we do not adequately address mental health in the United States. We do not battle the stigmas against getting counseling or asking for help. We are failing our young people by not getting to the root of why things like this happen. How do these young people get to that point where murder and suicide are the only options they feel they have left? Let�s not just scratch the surface by calling for stricter gun control. I pray that our nation will dig deep as a community, confront taboo issues and try to prevent future tragedies.
We now know who was responsible for the mass shootings at Virginia Tech and are relieved that he was not a terrorist. But suppose it had been a terrorist attack? This incident has no obvious homeland security dimensions: homeland security measures did not fail because they did not apply. But the homeland security implications of the attack should be troubling to those who protect us from terrorists because it isn�t obvious why those who do wish our destruction have not attacked us in the manner of the Virginia Tech massacre. The disturbingly simple method of the devastating Virginia Tech attack makes it a national security matter. How else can the easily replicated, methodical killing of 32 innocents be thought of as anything else?
Struck by unimaginable grief, an otherwise unsentimental man says, �We�ll need to act like a family.� Too bad no one thought of that before. Cho Seung-Hui was the invisible student. It was clear that he was deeply troubled. But instead of reaching out, those closest to him labeled him strange. Instead of intervening, they dismissed and ignored him. The shooting spree may have been unthinkable, but the suicide was foreseeable. If it had been solitary and silent, would anyone have cared, or even noticed? To prevent future massacres, we don�t need metal detectors, armed guards or reflexive campus lockdowns. We need more compassion and more humanity. We need to act more like a family.
Thank you to Lucinda Roy for finding the words to describe Blacksburg, Va., which many of us simply could not articulate during this time of shock and sorrow. Last weekend, three childhood friends were introduced at a wedding as �the Blacksburg girls�; my husband and I are the epitome of a �Blacksburg couple,� having met there in the first grade. Those terms will never mean the same thing again. Sadly, we cannot continue to say of our hometown, �You�ve never heard of it unless you follow college football.� Blacksburg is a beautiful place filled with beautiful people. Someday, it will return to being �boring,� but it will always be our �home in southwest Virginia.�
