Each year, I ask my seniors at Manual Arts High School in South Los Angeles if they have had direct experience with gun violence. They all raise their hands. They say they plot their paths to school based on the safest routes. They say gun violence is a reason that so many of their peers drop out of school. They and their younger siblings donï¿½t play outside. For people in communities like this all over this country, gun violence is a daily poison, breeding despair and hopelessness. America has focused on the drama of the Virginia Tech incident. The media will feed for weeks on this story. People who experience gun violence every day because they are poor or live in the wrong neighborhood have become part of the urban landscape and go unseen even when their stories make their way into newspapers or onto television. Gun violence never blights just individual lives. It blights families, neighborhoods and entire cities. It blights our whole country.
