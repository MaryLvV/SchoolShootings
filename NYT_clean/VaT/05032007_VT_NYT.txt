The wave of panic over students� creative writing, in response to the shootings at Virginia Tech, will do nothing to prevent actual violence, but threatens to straitjacket young people�s imagination.

If a murderer kills, it is not because he can imagine murder � we all can do that � but perhaps because he lacks the ability to imagine himself as one of his victims.
