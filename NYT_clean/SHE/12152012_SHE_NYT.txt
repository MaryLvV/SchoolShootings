I do not own a gun. In fact, I have never fired a gun with the exception of a BB gun as a teenager. Having said that, I wholeheartedly support the Second Amendment. However, I believe that we must begin to bring some sanity into this discussion. The unspeakable tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School should challenge us to consider these measures: �There should be a waiting period to purchase any gun or rifle. �There should be a background check on all potential gun purchasers. �The mentally ill and convicted criminals should not be allowed to purchase or have weapons. �AK-47s and other automatic weapons should not be sold (with exceptions for the military and law enforcement). �High-capacity magazines and Teflon bullets should not be sold. �Guns should not be able to be bought over the Internet. We can both maintain our Second Amendment rights and begin to put some safeguards in place to mitigate the likelihood of another Sandy Hook, Aurora, Virginia Tech and so on.
In the aftermath of yet another mass killing, both sides of the gun control debate trot out their dog-eared, tiresome talking points, repeated by a mass media eager to foment controversy. As one who suffers from mental illness, bipolar I, I fear that the crying need for better access to health care for those of us suffering from mental illness will be lost in the din of rhetoric over our �gun culture.� What about the stigma attached to mental illness and its damaging consequences? Yes, most of us do not commit acts of gun violence, but every instance of mass killings using guns involves a perpetrator with mental illness, the signs and symptoms of which were ignored or undetected out of ignorance or shame.
