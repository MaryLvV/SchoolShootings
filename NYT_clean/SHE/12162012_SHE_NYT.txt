As a high school senior, I am deeply saddened by the tragedy that befell our neighboring Connecticut school. The time has come when, as a society, we must identify, as early as possible, those children most in need of psychological intervention. Many schools periodically screen children for their eyesight and hearing. Similarly, we should be regularly screening our children for signs of psychological instability. Once identified, the children should be offered proper psychological intervention and treatment. It is time to destigmatize mental illness, identify it as promptly as possible and improve access to treatment.
Nicholas D. Kristof offers good suggestions for gun regulation (�Do We Have the Courage to Stop This?,� column, Dec. 16). I find it frustrating, though, that he doesn�t directly address the constitutional issue. It�s well past time to start a conversation regarding the repeal of the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment has become a dangerous anachronism, drafted in the 18th century for a sparsely populated frontier nation that had no police force to speak of and where flintlock muzzleloaders were state-of-art weapons. Ours is not that world. I am not calling for the outright ban and confiscation of firearms (though I�d like to); I am suggesting that repeal of the Second Amendment would remove any constitutional impediment to regulating firearms as we do automobiles.
The New York Times, Dec. 15, 2012: Page A1: �Gunman Massacres 20 Children at School in Connecticut.� Twenty children shot, 20 died. Page A9: �Man Stabs 22 Children in China.� Twenty-two received knife wounds, 22 survived. National Rifle Association claim: Guns don�t kill. People do. Case closed.
