President Obama should move swiftly to avoid a repeat of the unspeakable tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Before the end of this year, he should appoint a national commission to review our country�s gun laws. The commission should be made up of experts from the fields of law enforcement, school safety, mental health, academia and sociology and include a representative from a respected hunting organization. In short, a group of people with no political agenda who can quickly review the available data and recommend a course of action for Congress to take by the spring of 2013. The commission should study, among other things, the prospect of prohibiting interstate transportation of guns, requiring background criminal and psychiatric checks before gun purchases at gun shows, a ban once again on automatic weapons, and on high-capacity ammunition magazine � all of which could be approved by Congress and not violate the Supreme Court�s interpretation of the Second Amendment. We formed a commission after 9/11, one of the last times our country�s conscience and faith were shaken. I urge the president not to let this incident pass without his strong action.
When the heroes of Sandy Hook Elementary School defended 700 students against a lone gunman, they were also defending those children against an army of gun lobbyists � that force that continues to fight to allow hellish weapons to drop into the hands of our country�s Adam Lanzas. Gun zealots promote the fantasy that when faced with violence, any one of us � students, holiday shoppers and moviegoers � could click into commando mode and stop a maniac in a bulletproof vest, if only we were armed. But Nancy Lanza had staggering firepower. She couldn�t stop her own son. The gun lobbyists keep telling us that our �freedoms� depend on having the ability to kill one another, that this is the only way to protect our children. But don�t they see? It�s movie ushers, mall janitors and grade-school teachers who have to protect our children from them.
In too many mass shootings, when the bullets start flying, potential victims rightly run for their lives. Sometimes a hero emerges, someone who tried to stop the carnage. In the Connecticut shooting, instead of running away, teachers hid students, while the principal and other staff members reportedly ran toward the gunman to try to save the children. This is unimaginable heroism � to be willing to die for a child who is not your own. Who among us would be prepared to do this? We expect so much from our teachers and administrators, but never did we imagine this. Next time, when our teachers are being maligned for political sport, let us remember that on this day they were priceless.
We have been here before and we will be here again (�Obama Tells Town �These Tragedies Must End,� � front page, Dec. 17). Another blood bath, another vigil, another leader shedding tears, another legislator making promises. The sad fact is that nothing will be done. The corruption and cowardice of American politicians far exceed any concern for the welfare of the American people. God forbid our leaders show the bravery that the teachers and the students of Sandy Hook Elementary School displayed. Moreover, politicians know that in a short time we (and the media) will move on to something else. There is no need for me to send my condolences to the families of the Newtown victims. Enough people are already doing that. But let me be the first to send my condolences to the families of the victims of the next inevitable massacre.
So many of us have passed these sorrowful days asking that one-word question: �Why?� The answer is in the first line of your front-page news article: �Nancy Lanza loved guns� (�A Mother, a Gun Enthusiast and the First Victim,� Dec. 16). Now the questions are: Why would the mother of a mentally unstable son teach him how to shoot? Why would she have unsecured guns accessible to him? And, finally, why did she need those guns in the first place? As with so many gun owners, few go out in a blaze of glory either defending themselves or others. Statistics show that the gun owner or a family member will more likely be killed or maimed by his or her firearm. In the end, the hand that rocked Adam�s cradle also put a gun within his reach.
