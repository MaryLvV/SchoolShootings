Wouldn't it be a wondrous thing if, in the aftermath of our latest national tragedy, every rational, feeling member of the National Rifle Association were to follow the example of Senators Joe Manchin III and Mark Warner and call for a less rigid stance toward gun control? Wouldn't it be amazing if every constituent of a pro-N.R.A. representative were to sign a petition stating strong support for more effective restrictions on weapons in this country? It's hard to believe there are that many Americans who genuinely believe that easy access to the tools of destruction makes the world a better place to live in.
