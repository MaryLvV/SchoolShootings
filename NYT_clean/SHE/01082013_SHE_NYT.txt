I have only seven guns in my house. As a resident of rural South Texas, this makes me practically a Quaker. Some of my guns I bought, some I inherited from my father and some I held for my son while he was in the Army. I hunt on rare occasions and enjoy a little target shooting. I�ve killed a dozen rattlesnakes and a rabid raccoon on my place. A couple of times I was comforted to have a gun when I politely asked trespassers to leave my property � now. The point is I like my guns, but I do not love them. Love is reserved for the likes of the children and teachers who died so senselessly in Sandy Hook. This and other recent tragedies serve to focus our minds on a complex blend of Second Amendment rights, public safety, civil society and mental health. I do not know what solution we will ultimately find. My own personal and immediate reaction, though, was to take a large-capacity ammo clip and pound it down with a hammer. My ranch rifle works fine without it, and it was stupid to have. I don�t need it, and I don�t think anyone does.
