Many have said the teen-agers suspected of committing the killings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., were hurt by the teasing of other students and felt isolated from the student body (front page, April 26). This is not a unique phenomenon. Many school systems have instituted peer mediation programs as a way to deflect the intensity of such conflicts before they reach the level of an armed attack. The role of a professional mediator or peer mediator is to facilitate conflict resolution through the use of verbal communication. Mediation teaches students to cope with conflict in the most constructive manner possible and not resort to violence.
