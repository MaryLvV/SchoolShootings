Your April 21 editorial on the shooting at Columbine High School suggests that more effort be made to identify ''potential troublemakers.'' But if this is accompanied by their vilification, it may only increase the sense of isolation. The media fixation on the ''trench coat mafia'' is a first sign of such vilification. Identifying students who look different and failing to spot troubled youths who do not stand out may fail to prevent, and even reinforce, destructive behavior. Identifying ''types'' also smacks of police procedures that single out members of minority groups. We must instead focus on the more difficult questions, like why this phenomenon is becoming so widespread and how children are able to obtain and build the weapons to carry out such destruction.
