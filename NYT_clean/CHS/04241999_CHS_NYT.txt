I found the timing and content of Sally L. Satel's April 23 Op-Ed article, ''An Overabundance of Counseling?'', disturbing. Dr. Satel's second-guessing of the needs of victims in the aftermath of tragedy irresponsibly interferes with the healing process that the people of Littleton, Colo., need most. Dr. Satel is right to assert that grief counseling does not aid all people, but surely she knows that no mental or medical intervention helps all people. Her argument is further diminished by her unnecessary description of one overzealous counselor as if his efforts typified the work of all counselors. Dr. Satel is correct to point out that communities may indeed be equipped ''to soothe and strengthen themselves,'' but where is the harm in offering assistance when it is asked for?
