While few would argue that groups of friends sticking together is a negative thing, Nathan Black's April 29 Op-Ed article on the harmlessness of high school cliques regrettably ignores the dangerous ways in which cliques operate. It's not simply that different students are in cliques because they fit in with others in the clique. In most schools there is a clear hierarchy of cliques. The students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., who shot their classmates were in a clique at the bottom of that hierarchy, marking them as targets of ridicule for students in other cliques looking for an easy way to demonstrate their social superiority. Just as in general society, those identified with inferior groups are inevitably treated as objects rather than as people. The result is anger and resentment, which when combined with other unstable and dangerous influences can have horrible consequences.
