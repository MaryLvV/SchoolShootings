Although the people responsible for the events in Littleton, Colo., represent a small percentage of high school students in this country, the number will grow if we do not do something about violence (front page, April 28). In September 1998, the Jersey City Board of Education adopted a zero-tolerance policy regarding violence and weapons. Enforcement of the policy revealed the depth of our problem. In the first three months alone, there were almost 120 cases of children caught with weapons or accused of committing acts of violence. Of these, 60 percent were in kindergarten through the sixth grade. Some children choose violence and weapons as a means to communicate. We have allowed hatred and prejudice to replace the tolerance and compassion that are essential if we are to survive as a community.
