The tale of the boy whose parents took away his computer because of what they saw on television about the tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. (new article, May 3), should worry us.

A more practical approach is to start early in teaching children how to evaluate what they are watching on television or what they are discovering on the Internet. To do this takes time and effort by parents. It will require parents and young children to routinely watch television and explore the Internet together and establish the habit of conversing about what they are watching.
