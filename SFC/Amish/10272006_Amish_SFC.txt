Amish murders baffle
Editor -- Steven Winn's article on the tragedy in the Pennsylvania Amish school ("Nothing can kill the hope and resilience of kids," Oct. 11) is very moving and filled with deep insight. It would be so easy to just recoil in horror from this incident and try to blot it from our minds. But Winn's response is well thought out, reasoned, full of truth and hope for children and our nation.
The response of the Amish in mourning the loss of their daughters shows that this nation has not completely lost its way. To show forgiveness and mercy to the family of the shooter is the way to begin to heal what seems impossible to heal.

Editor -- As always, Steven Winn's observations regarding the murders in an Amish community were to and from the heart. When you think of the horrors children have witnessed and survived, it is a wonderment transcending any psychological theories.
