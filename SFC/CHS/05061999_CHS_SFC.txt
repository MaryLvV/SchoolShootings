PARENTAL AUTHORITY -- A FULL-TIME ISSUE
Editor -- Since the Columbine High School massacre, there has been a clarion call for parents to be more aware of what is happening in the lives of their children.
I agree.
Parents are obligated to do so. It's a 24-hour-a-day responsibility, not just a once-in-a-while, don't-bother- me-now, I'll-talk-to-you-about-it-later responsibility.
However, when parents want to exert their parental authority by keeping their children from having abortions, why is it that Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, NARAL and other such groups want to prevent parents from being aware of what is happening to their children.
Why the hypocrisy?
