What leads to a Red Lake tragedy?
Editor -- Regarding your editorial, "Mystery of Red Lake" (March 24): There is no mystery. Children need to be tended to by loving parents or care- givers until they are able to forge out into the world alone, armed with character, resolve, morals and gumption.
The 16-year-old Jeff Weise (whose shooting attacks in Minnesota left 10 people dead) had none of these gifts. His dad had shot himself, and his mom ended up in a nursing home with disabling injuries from an auto accident.
Your editorial focuses on the end result -- a killing rampage. Just for once, perhaps, we should focus on underlying causes of this type of behavior and try, through mental-health experts, counselors and clergy, to stave off the horrible depression and extreme loneliness that this boy, and many others like him, suffer for so many years.
What he did was wrong, and he alone will have to undergo judgment for it. But please don't say it was a mystery. Your own paper spelled out how wretched life was and still is at Red Lake. Therein lies the problem.

Editor -- After the Columbine High School murder-suicides in Colorado, the media and the nation were introspective as to the cause of such senseless violence. Many blamed exposure to violence in films and video games. Others blamed the easy availability of guns.
With the recent Red Lake tragedy, it is apparent that there is a common element influencing some young killers. They have been under medication with the psychotropic drug Prozac.
Of course you could surmise that it was their depression at the root of the teens' behavior. But there always have been depressed people.
