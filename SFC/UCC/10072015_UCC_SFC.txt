Empathy and frustration has emerged from inside of me after the tragedy that has befallen Umpqua Community College. In light of yet another shooting in our great nation, I find the ambivalence relating to gun-control laws in the United States hard to comprehend. How many more gun-related tragedies must our country endure before our chosen delegates, our elected civil servants, take action for the greater good of our citizens? The time for change has arrived, made apparent by those that have lost their lives because of gun violence. Misguided and unstable individuals are able to purchase firearms legally and outright. The culprit in the most recent shooting in Roseburg, Ore., was in possession of 13 firearms, far too many guns necessary for one individual to own. The time has come for the U.S. government to make our communities and our citizens safer. It would be a travesty to allow gun violence to continue. It is my hope that the next president of the United States will enact legislation that limits the number of guns one person may own and instills a more methodical background check for those attempting to purchase a gun.
