The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's front page on Tuesday was sickening in horror and hypocrisy: Megafarmers ripping us off on subsidies ("Farmers accused of 'scheme' wind up keeping millions"); the murders at the Amish school ("Vengeful intruder binds, kills girls before taking own life"); and the disgrace of Mark Foley ("Scandal puts Republicans on defensive"). Has the AJC forgotten Democrat Bill Clinton and his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky? All of the above indicate a real need for moral people to boycott most movies, television shows and businesses that glamorize killings, immorality and illegal greed. The AJC could also show a lot less hypocrisy in political reporting, on the front and editorial pages.
