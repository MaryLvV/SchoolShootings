What happened Saturday in rural Pennsylvania shows the better side of humanity ("Amish mourn schoolgirl's killer," News, Oct. 8). At the funeral of the murderer of the five innocent Amish children, dozens of Amish came to show forgiveness to the killer and concern for his wife and relatives. The world could use more of this type of humankind than the rampant terrorism and destruction of life we see around the planet.
The Amish mourn the killer. I wonder how many of us "Christians" could take a few lessons from the Amish on a thing called "grace." They seem absurdly quaint to us, but they've kept the essential kernel of our faith that most of the rest of us seem to have lost these days. I am thankful to them.
