The Amish bury their dead. Young girls executed in cold blood. Local boy Aaron Kincaid is killed by a bomb in Iraq ("Soldier also 'great father, husband, son,' " Metro, Oct. 6). Thirteen U.S. soldiers died last week in Iraq. And on the Movies & More page of Oct. 6, Steve Murray, in big bold type, glorifies the film violence of Martin Scorsese's "Greatest Hits" by writing in vivid detail how various characters have hurt and maimed their victims. On the front page, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution bemoans the violence that has infiltrated even a tiny Amish community. Yet on the movie page, violence is eye-catching and entertaining. Do you not see the connection?
The horrific evil of the Pennsylvania school massacre was offset by the powerful witness of a community that takes literally Jesus' command to turn the other cheek. Sadly, the sidebar by reporter John Blake ("Hope springs from moving on without anger, survivors say," Page One, Oct. 6) offered us only universalist psychobabble about forgiveness and reconciliation without once mentioning the values that actually motivate Amish Christians. Is the AJC afraid of Christian fundamentalism even when it keeps to the byways in horses and buggies? In truth, if loving our enemies came as naturally to most of us as it does to those who take the New Testament seriously, you would not have to put a story about it on the front page.
