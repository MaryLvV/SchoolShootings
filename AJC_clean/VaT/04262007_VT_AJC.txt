After serving the public as a Marine and Vietnam veteran, bomb technician and law enforcement officer, I still have difficulty understanding the American public's fascination with firearms. Upon my retirement as a law enforcement executive, the people I worked with struggled to come up with a suitable gift. Traditionally, firearms were purchased. Since I would be receiving my credentials and service weapon as part of my compensation, my co-workers knew that I had little use for another firearm. With the horrible shootings at Virginia Tech and the equally horrible police shootings of two unarmed young men in College Park, I've concluded that the proliferation of firearms in the American culture is a dangerous proposition. Even in the hands of people who're supposedly trained in their proper use, guns still present an unnecessary danger to the American public in the hands of civilians and police alike.
