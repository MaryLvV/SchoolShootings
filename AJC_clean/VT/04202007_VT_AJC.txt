It was sad to read the outraged responses to Mike Luckovich's cartoon. Did the readers not get it? As tragic as the Virginia Tech incident is, we are daily losing equally innocent lives in Iraq. Quietly. Without sensational headlines. Their parents grieve as wholly as the parents of the students who were slain. Further, the cartoon appeared to me to be a reminder that we have, perhaps, become complacent once again concerning our national security. It would be beneficial if our first response to any stimulus was to open our minds and thoughtfully consider what the person may be trying to say.
I have to comment after reading the April 18 letters grouped under the heading "Luckovich cartoon" that were filled with righteous indignation over the Mike Luckovich cartoon of the previous day. Obviously, these letter writers are too "knee-jerk reactionary" to comprehend the irony that Luckovich successfully and tastefully imbued in just a simple statement. The cartoon was neither insensitive nor exploitative. But the letters against it certainly were.
Mike Luckovich provided an excellent observation with his April 18 cartoon of the Virginia Tech-filled Iraq map. Please ignore the calls for an apology from your other readers. Once again Luckovich has shown how we claim we value lives at home while ignoring the atrocities we inflict on other countries and on our own armed forces.
