I want to applaud Charles Krauthammer for his April 20 column about the political uproar arising from the Virginia Tech shootings ("Psychosis is too serious for political games," ). People need to realize that this tragedy should not be the jump-start of some political crusade against guns, but the beginning of society's understanding of severe mental illnesses. After Columbine, people tried to blame video games, goth culture and social elitism in high schools for the shootings, yet no one seemed to consider the notion that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold may have had some serious mental health issues. Ultimately, I refuse to believe that mass killers are just evil people. They have illnesses that can be treated if they have the courage to seek help despite living in a society that stigmatizes mental illness so much.
What's changed in our society that could cause someone to go on a shooting rampage like that guy at Virginia Tech? One thing stands out: antidepressants. According to the Citizens Commission for Human Rights, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, irritability, hostility, impulsivity, severe restlessness and mania were among the FDA warnings for antidepressants. CCHR adds that many of the school shooters "were taking psychiatric drugs at the time of their crime." So, just how many people have to die before someone arrests the real killer?
