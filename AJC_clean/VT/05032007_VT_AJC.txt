Kevin O'Brien's pro-concealed-weapons column ("Carrying a concealed weapon saved the day . . . and many others," April 30) is shot full of holes in logic. His concluding line suggested that things might have been different at Virginia Tech if the shooter hadn't been the only one with a gun on campus. I have to agree: Things might have been a lot worse. Ever heard of crossfire? It's not just an old CNN show. Who knows how many would have been killed in a major shoot-out? Gun lovers don't feel whole without a firearm.
