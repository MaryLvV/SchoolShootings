I can not sit back for this one, something must be said. When the people of American can not speak their minds without getting blasted by armed government troops one must wonder what this once great country is coming to. What has happened to our freedoms? What of our freedoms of speech and assembly? Is the Kent State massacre an indication of what will happen in the future to dissenters? The threat of a fascist state hangs more heavily over our heads than ever before. The placards reading 'The world is doomed' were more accurate than the prophets knew. Unless responsible action is taken soon by all good citizens we can say 'goodbye' to the declaration of 1776 and 'hello' to 1984.
