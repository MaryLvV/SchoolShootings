I am one of the "Silent Majority," but I can no longer remain silent. Monday's inexcusable killings at Kent State University cause me to protest the action by the National Guard and the authorities responsible for their presence. I never thought I'd see bullets used against rock-throwing students in America. Nixon's response blaming the violence of the students, rather than questioning the use of bullets by the guard also disappoints me. I believe the students have a reason for dissent. I want to see us get out of this hopeless war. Nixon might be surprised at which majority has been silent.
