Wayne LaPierre and the NRA missed the mark at the recent press conference regarding gun control and school security. Basically, it seems that we should let anyone -- including the bad guys -- get the guns, because officers in the schools will find them and shoot them. God forbid that a student is gunned down by the officer in the process. This is so reactive: Sell the arms first, and we will deal with things after the transaction clears. It seems the NRA is more worried about profit than security. I am not a hunter, nor a law enforcement officer, so I do not need a gun. There are a lot of other ways to keep my home safe. Regarding schools, I want my children to trust, not fear, the law enforcement officers at school. There is no reason to get arms in schools if we make sure, as we should, that arms to do not make it inside them.
