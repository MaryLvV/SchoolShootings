In the ongoing trauma created by the recent massacre of children in Connecticut, people are grasping for any reasonable way to prevent a recurrence. This may be a tough thing to do, as troubled people who normally may have committed suicide in private now find they can instead go out in a blaze of publicized glory. Opponents and proponents of gun ownership are in a froth over who is to blame for the tragedy. I suspect the majority of Americans believe in some common-sense measures that would displease those on both sides of the debate. Something on the order of stricter checks on a person's criminal and mental background, and banning military-type assault weapons and their large clips seems like a reasonable, measured way to start. The fact that the "ban all guns" groups and the "sell any and all guns to anybody" groups would dislike such proposals may point toward their reasonableness. Sometimes, who you disagree with can be a badge of honor.
Many have suggested that arming teachers is the only reasonable response to tragedies such as those that occurred in Newtown. Let me get this straight: Kind, caring, elementary school teachers -- the majority of whom have no desire to carry a deadly weapon -- should be compelled to keep a loaded, lethal firearm in close proximity to the small children they are trying to educate, just to preserve the privilege of a vocal minority? That they expect this notion to be taken seriously shows just how out of touch and disturbed the firearms apologists have become.
