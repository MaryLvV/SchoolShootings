Imagine how much faster the shootings at Columbine High School, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook Elementary School would have ended, and how many lives would have been saved, if an adult who challenged the killers had a firearm. Our problem isn't too many guns. Our problem is that government has created areas where killers know that their victims will be defenseless by law. We need to repeal the gun-free school laws so that background-checked parents and teachers can effectively protect our children with firearms.
