In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy and similar tragedies, our nation has gone into a frenzy to find a solution. Some people demand tighter gun controls and limits on the Second Amendment. Others demand media controls and limits on the First Amendment. Still others demand that better mental health care be made available. I think some measure looking at all three approaches is necessary. The NRA, in blaming the media -- specifically, movies and video games -- is disingenuous. Other countries have the same movies and video games, yet these countries do not experience the violence that has become prevalent here. Why? Other countries have limited gun availability, yet maintain a system of private gun ownership that assures personal freedom. Why can't something similar be implemented here? Blaming somebody else is not going to proffer a solution. We must remove from the equation those with an ulterior agenda, and address the problem honestly. Otherwise, nothing will be done, and more innocents will die.
