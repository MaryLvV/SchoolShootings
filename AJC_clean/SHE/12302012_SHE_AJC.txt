I do not own any guns -- particularly any of the so-called "assault" weapons -- but I am so angry over the media's continuous attention to the premise that the particular type of firearm used in the tragic Newtown shootings is the root of the problem. It is not the type of weapon used, but the fact that a deranged person was able to get a weapon with ammunition and use it. What arguments would you be hearing today on TV or the radio if the shooter had used a commonly found pump-action shotgun and a common handgun? He may have killed a few less children, but would that tragedy be any less a tragedy if only 15 children had been brutally murdered? This debate, so much anchored in the evil of "assault" weapons, to me is not just inane; it is detrimental to making substantive progress to making the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy unlikely to ever occur again.
