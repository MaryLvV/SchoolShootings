As a parent of a high school student, I was horrified by the armed attack at Columbine High School. It is natural for parents in Littleton to look for a reason and someone or something to blame. The fact that the two youths who committed the murders took their own lives makes it even more difficult to cope with. So who's to blame? Is it mental illness, irresponsible parenting, genetics, government policies, public schools, the National Rifle Association, society at large? Perhaps the real problem, if you want to call it that, is that despite a loving God, evil in its worst forms exists in our world. The fact is there are no real answers for the devastated parents and students of Littleton, except perhaps through their faith. I will leave it to priests, ministers, and rabbis to explain why an all-powerful God would allow the slaughter of innocent children in Colorado or Kosovo.
