In response to the violent tragedy at Columbine High School, President Clinton quoted the New Testament and suggested that we Americans pray for the families of the murdered and injured students. If these young people who committed this crime had grown up with prayer in the school, freedom to read the Bible in school and the Ten Commandments on display, these murders would not have taken place. There are numerous causes for these killings. One is the American Civil Liberties Union and its legal challenges against the Judeo-Christian concepts upon which our country was formed. Another is parents too willing to sue the school systems so that the teachers and principals no longer have the authority to discipline the youths entrusted to their care.
The lack of Judeo-Christian family values caused these young people to turn on their fellow students. Also to blame is the violent nature of the entertainment industry.
Perhaps National Rifle Association President Charlton Heston would like fly to Denver and explain to the faculty, students and parents of the students at Columbine High School just how important it is for Americans to have guns. The NRA tries to get a lot out of its simplistic, and empty rhethoric, but the truth is simple: Guns let people kill people, and allow them to do it most efficiently. This adherence to the letter, and not the intent, of the 2nd Amendment is a greater threat to our liberty.
