I was sitting in my computer class and I started to think about the tragedy that occured Tuesday in Colorado. I started to write down how I felt. This is the result.
The carnage at Columbine High School horrified the entire nation. I can't believe that the mistakes of so few can forever change the lives of so many. It amazes me how some teenagers seem to think that the only way to make a statement is through violence. I just don't understand why. Why would anyone want to shatter the lives of innocent children?
What makes kids think that they can solve their problems by hurting other people? Why would anyone do such a thing? What was going through their minds? I just don't understand. When did the world become so unsafe and unfair? To take someone's life before they really have a chance to live it is such a terrible crime.
Didn't they think about all the innocent people that they were hurting? Didn't they think about all the parents whose lives would never be the same? Didn't they realize that kids all over the nation would see their crime played out on television and it could forever alter the way that they look at the world?
I am only 15 and I really feel like I have a lot of life left to live. That is why I am having such a hard time understanding how other teenagers could just decide that they not only wanted to end their own lives, but that they also wanted to take 15 of their classmates with them. What is so wrong with the world that young people get into the mind-set that they no longer want to live in it? I guess that is a question that will never be answered.
