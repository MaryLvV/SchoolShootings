Gun control whiners are calling for more gun control laws. It has been reported that the teenagers responsible for the Columbine shootings violated no fewer than 19 current gun control laws, so why do people think that more gun control laws would have done anything to prevent this tragedy? The unbalanced kooks and nuts in our society will always get guns if they want them, and the criminals buy guns on the street, not at gun stores where they can be traced to the purchaser. The only people who are truly affected by gun control are law-abiding citizens. We don't need more gun control. We need more kid control. We don't need more laws. We need more parents.
The recent horror at Columbine High School has once again revealed the irrationality of the position of the National Rifle Association. An examination of the criminological and epidemiological data reveals that a disproportionate percentage of violent crimes are traced to purchases made at unregulated events such as gun shows, or originate from gun manufacturers with lax or nonexistent inventory and security. It's comparable to the small but significant percentage of cars that have failed emissions inspections being responsible for much of the air pollution. Yet the NRA steadfastly opposes any regulation of sales at gun shows, and has lobbied to gut the funding of agencies such as the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, making them incapable of enforcing laws prosecuting irresponsible gun manufacturers. This betrays a lack of regard and accountability, both to the significant majority of responsible gun owners and to the public. The NRA showed the same lack of regard and accountability when it lobbied against the regulation and control of Teflon-coated "cop killer" bullets, causing the police chiefs to write them off. The NRA interprets the Second Amendment to read: "unregulated domestic arms trafficking." This leads to anarchy, not freedom.
