I, too, noticed the lesser media coverage of the recent shootings at Northern Illinois University, but I caution readers against equating media coverage with "outreach." As a 2007 alum of Virginia Tech and friend of a victim in the December mall shooting in Omaha, I was relieved to observe this decrease in media obsession. Last April in Blacksburg, I remember fearing desperately that media focus, especially on the shooter, could lead to idolization of the shooter by similarly disturbed individuals and the unimaginable tragedy that happened on our campus happening again elsewhere. And now it has. Many Hokies urged the media to stop coverage on the shooter and to give space to victims, their families and the university community. At the same time, separate from cameras and reporters, we felt a great comfort from the outreach of the community, nation and world. Send NIU a banner from your hometown or donations to support the families in the aftermath. But don't encourage the media - because the media, as unintentional as they may be, could be indirectly contributing to more of these types of shootings.
