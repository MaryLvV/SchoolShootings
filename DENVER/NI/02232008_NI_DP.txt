I am so saddened by the recent shootings at Northern Illinois University. Yet, I am equally saddened by the lack of coverage and concern from the media. Are school shootings now so common that they do not merit more coverage? I remember how we as a nation reached out to Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. Yet, I did not experience our nation reaching out to Northern Illinois in the same manner or degree. I hope we have not become so callous to these things that it no longer effects us. God forbid, but if there is another school shooting, will we even care?
