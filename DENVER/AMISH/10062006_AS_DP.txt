It goes without saying that our thoughts and prayers are with both the families of the victims of the recent school shootings and the families of children across the country as they continue to head into school each day. However, I am highly disappointed with the media's coverage of the school shootings in both Colorado and Pennsylvania. It is the media's job to ask the tough questions. The tough question in these cases is not "Why did he shoot those innocent children?" when referring to Charles Carl Roberts IV and Duane Morrison. Is there anything in either man's childhood or recent history that we should accept as an explanation of or justification for their behavior?



No. The more appropriate question, and the harder one to ask, is why did both of these men decide to excuse all the male students and keep only female students to terrorize? What is it in our society that makes them think that the appropriate victims for their rage is innocent girls? This question is hardest to ask because it makes us look at more than just the individuals involved in the shooting but at ourselves, and at society at large.

Roberts entered the Amish school house with sexual lubricant and bound his female victims together, as if acting out a scene straight out of a pornographic film. This comparison has yet to be made, but we have no hesitation comparing the shooting to Columbine, a shooting in which gender made no difference and in which it was essentially children harming other children.

Indeed, it is time for the media to step up and ask the hard questions. Because if not them, who? And if no one, what's to stop this tragedy from occurring again and again?
