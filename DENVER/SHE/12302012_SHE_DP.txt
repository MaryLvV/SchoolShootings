The editors feel that the idea of armed police in every school is off base. To be sure, our priority must be to identify and treat potentially dangerous mentally deranged persons and make sure they have no access to firearms. But neither that nor any amount of "gun control" will do anything to ensure the safety of our children in the short term. If we are truly interested in making our schools safer rather than scoring political points, it is time to lose the leftist ideology and think a bit outside the box.

In the wake of Columbine, there are already armed officers in many Colorado schools. The only way to stop an active shooter is to have someone on the scene with the actual ability to stop him before the rampage. The police never show up in time to stop the carnage. They get there just in time to draw chalk outlines around the bodies.

Had a fully trained armed guard been present at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the police might have counted only two or three bodies instead of 26.
