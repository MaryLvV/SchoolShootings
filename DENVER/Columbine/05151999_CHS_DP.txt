Forgotten Columbine?

In the last two days, I have realized how quickly our elected officials forget (the Columbine tragedy) and are willing to roll over for blood money from the NRA. I am dumbfounded by the vote from Colorado's two senators to reject the attempt to enforce background checks for gun sales at gun shows. Their rationale is it will curtail the personal freedom to bear arms - but the reality is one of money and influence. Wayne Allard and Ben Nighthorse Campbell have slapped us in the face with the reality of the NRA lobbying in the U.S. Congress.

When will we wake up in the face of the pressing problem of gun control - how can elected officials betray our faith and vote with such utter disregard? Why have our two senators so quickly forgotten the tragedy of Columbine? SCOTT SIMMONS

Wake up, senators! I was disturbed to read that our country's government is now run by the National Rifle Association. I'm especially concerned that Colorado's senators voted against making all dealers at gun shows get a background check. I wonder how they would have voted if one of their own would have been in class at Columbine.

All I can say to those who voted against these background checks is - please wake up. ARTHUR M. HIGGINS
