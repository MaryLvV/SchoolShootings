Come on! Blaming the Virginia Tech body count on the peace movement of the '60s? Does Billie Louden seriously believe anyone in those rooms thought, "I don't want to die, but fighting back would go against my non-confrontational ethic"? The truth is, those teachers and students were probably too far from the shooter to subdue him and were likely sitting in chairs with desks attached that prevented them from lunging quickly forward to stop Seung-Hui Cho. Louden seems to think the victims were mentally weak and passive. She's implying that if she, with her military and law enforcement training, had been in one of those rooms, she would have heroically saved the day, and that if only we all taught our kids to be confrontational warriors, they wouldn't be such passive sheep ripe for slaughter. The truth is Americans will fight if the situation merits it. Once the passengers of United Flight 93 knew what was up, they acted heroically. If Cho had been wielding fists or a knife, he would have been quickly subdued. But our fighting spirit is no match for a Glock with a semi-automatic clip. Sorry, Billie, peace is not the problem. Easy access to semi-automatic weapons is.
