Misplaced blame?



Re: "Church plans to protest services of victims," April 20 news story.



So, Fred Phelps believes the Virginia Tech massacre was God's punishment for America's tolerance of homosexuals? Well, if by tolerance he means 1) a pervasive social climate of derision and disapproval of having homosexual feelings; 2) general disdain for showing public displays of affection between members of the same sex; 3) potential beatings and possible death at the hands of strangers for being out and open with one's sexuality; and 4) nationwide legal prohibitions on recognizing same-sex relationships, then America's darn more tolerant than I thought it was.



As we collectively ponder the deadly motivations of Seung-Hui Cho and his manifesto of alleged taunts and abuses by his fellow students, we should give thanks that none of the millions of gays, lesbians and bisexuals among us doesn't mentally snap, pick up a gun and violently lash out at a society that denigrates their humanity on a daily basis - in word, deed and law.
