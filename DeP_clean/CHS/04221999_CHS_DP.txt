While watching television coverage of the Columbine tragedy, I heard people discuss what should be done to stop this from happening again. Not once did anyone mention banning guns. Wake up America. As long as you have guns you will never get rid of violence. Of course, violence on TV and the Internet needs to be removed, but guns are at the root of the problem. The answer is not to arm yourself against other guns but to disarm the whole nation. Why doesn't Europe have as high a crime rate as America? Simply because guns are not a right, and are not something that anyone wants. They look at America with disgust for the sick society it has become. American's rights as citizens to live peaceably should override their rights to own a gun.
The legislators (and presumably the governor) believe it is a great idea to allow concealed weapons. Are any of them watching the TV news right now? Are any of them parents of those kids shot at Columbine High? To legislators who voted in favor of concealed weapons: What do you plan to tell the parents of those innocent kids shot today? It is interesting that Colorado legislators want to be able to tell the federal government that they are experts at, specifically, what endangered species can be introduced into Colorado on federal land, yet deny local governments the same authority with regard to regulating firearms. However, the legislators do not want concealed weapons in the state Capitol. So, weapons are OK everywhere else? Will it be OK to have weapons in supermarket parking lots and schools? If anyone cares about our Colorado kids, he or she will demand that legislators re-think this legislation and Governor Owens vetos the concealed weapons bill.
While Colorado's Legislature debates "right to carry" legislation, a tragedy occurred in Littleton that may have been prevented if there had been a few teachers carrying firearms. It is sad that our society has deteriorated to the point that in order to make it safe again, we must be armed. "Right-to-carry" laws have worked all over the country in reducing crime. It might have worked at Columbine High School, too.
The frightful tragedy at Columbine High School should settle for once and all the question whether mature and law-abiding teachers and school administrators should be allowed the means to protect themselves and their students. It would appear that the original Musgrave gun carry law is closest to right. Restrict them from bars and let it go at that.
