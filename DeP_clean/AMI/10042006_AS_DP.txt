Why on earth are we not teaching martial arts in our kids' gym classes? There's been yet another school shooting, at an Amish school in Pennsylvania. This makes three deadly school shootings in the U.S. within a week. Enough! Our kids really don't deserve to grow up this way. When I was in high school, 1978-81, in gym class we had a great thing called "life sports," which included things like cross-country skiing, bowling and even square dancing. The idea was that we would learn skills that we would keep and practice our entire lives. Why don't we apply the "life sports" concept to include the martial arts - basic self defense for all, taught for a minimum of, say, two months?
