I read with some sadness the article about Korean-Americans feeling a "sense of shame, guilt." Unhappily, they may be wise to preemptively voice these sentiments, since rightly or wrongly we humans do tend to scapegoat and assign "collective guilt." It is the natural reverse face of the same coin that gives us "bragging rights" for things done well by other representatives of "our" family, team or country. It is evident in everything from seesawing Franco-German war reparations to bumper stickers imploring, "Don't blame me, I voted for ï¿½ ." Still, while I cannot speak for the victims at Virginia Tech, I wish to express that I and hopefully most Americans do not think less of the Korean community for the actions of one individual, any more than I would blame Arab-Americans for Sept. 11. I hope that I, in turn, will not have to bear responsibility for the many sins of Euro-Americans, both here and throughout the world. We each have enough personal responsibility to bear.
