ILL-TIMED NRA RALLY
Editor -- Is anyone as appalled as I was to read that the National Rifle Association and its president, Charlton Heston, held a rally in Tucson just two days after a nursing student at the University of Arizona there had shot to death three of his professors? This followed rallies in Denver days after the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and a rally in Flint, Mich., shortly after a 6-year-old girl was shot to death by her classmate.
How callous and insensitive can the NRA be?
